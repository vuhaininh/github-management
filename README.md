# Installation Guide
This is application to view Github repositories of organizations. (such as rails, google ... )

Online Demo link: https://vuhaininh.github.io/github-management/

Application runs well on Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge. I do not have Mac so cannot test with Safari (Apple does not support Safari in Windows for years).

I do not have paid organization git hub so I ignored the toggle/filter private/public part
